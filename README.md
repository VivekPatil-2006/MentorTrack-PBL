# MentorTrack(Academic Tracking and Monitoring System)
This project presents the development of a Mentor Tracking System aimed at 
enhancing academic monitoring in a semester-based Bachelor of Engineering (BE) 
program. The system supports four user roles: Admin, Teacher, Technician, and 
Student. The primary objective is to streamline mentorship by assigning teachers as 
mentors to specific student groups and enabling continuous tracking of their academic 
performance. Admins manage user registrations and assign mentors, while teachers 
monitor student progress, provide feedback, and facilitate communication. 
Technicians assist by entering academic data such as Unit Test 1 (UT1), Unit Test 2 
(UT2), and Insem scores, ensuring accurate and timely record-keeping. Students can 
view their performance and interact with mentors through individual communication 
modules. Key features include personalized logins, role-based access control, 
centralized performance tracking, and enhanced mentor-student interaction. The 
platform promotes efficient academic supervision, data confidentiality, and consistent 
engagement between stakeholders, ultimately contributing to improved educational 
outcomes.
